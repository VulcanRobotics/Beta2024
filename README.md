# Beta2024
Team 1218's new robot code repository for FRC 2024 season:
* Based on the initial 3.0.0 release of Team 6328's AdvantageKit - AdvancedSwerveDriveProject code, distributed here:
    * https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit/releases

This code base provides an ideal starting point for our FRC 2024 plan, which prioritizes the following:
* Swerve drive using TalonFX motors (via CTRE's Phoenix libraries)
* Full integration of AdvantageKit for input-output logging and simulaton
* Highly accurate swerve drive odometry, logged and visualized using AdvantageKit/Scope
* Full support for PathPlanner, for accurate and reliable auton modes
* Use of Shuffleboard for drive station instrumentation (no more SmartDashboard!)

Necessary features that will be added in the future:
* Support for a shooter
* Support for an intake
* Integration of Limelight and AprilTag tracking to enhance odometry and shooting accuracy
